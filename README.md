# My Portfolio

My Portfolio is a personal web application project that I‚Äôve developed to showcase my professional skills, work experience, and projects.

The portfolio includes sections such as:

- **About Me.** A brief introduction about myself.
- **Skills.** A detailed list of my up-to-date technical skills, broken down to front-end, back-end, cloud, databases, and other tools that I‚Äôm proficient in.
- **Work Experience.** A timeline of my work history, roles, responsibilities, and key achievements in each position.
- **Projects.** A showcase of my professional projects excluding personal projects, with descriptions, responsibilities, and technologies used. There are some technologies indicated in this section that are not displayed under skills. It means, that I have no longer used them, but remains in the working knowledge category.
